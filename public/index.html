                <p class="lead">Most people don't know how good you are supposed to feel in your body. We have normalized wearing stress like a badge of honor, pushing too hard until our bodies start to fail us in some way.</p>
                <p>Instead of listening to the quiet screams, we think we need someone else to make us better, and some magic pills to fix us. But there is no magic pill. And no one else can save you, but you. And it is not always what you think. <strong>There are other ways.</strong></p>
                <p>Your health is your greatest asset. I'm here to help you unlock this potential through intelligent practices, movement and yoga, to teach you how to listen: to what your body truly needs to get better. How to live in harmony with your natural feminine rhythms, and to hold space for your return to homeostasis.</p>
                <p class="highlight">We were just never actually taught how to do that.</p>

                    <p>When you think of yoga, you might think of a girl in plastic leggings doing yoga "exercises." Yes, I do this too, but there is SO much more to yoga than meets the eye. It is a whole health system, where the body is seen for more than the individual parts, but where each part works together as a whole.</p>
